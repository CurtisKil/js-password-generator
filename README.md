# Unit 03 JavaScript Homework: Password Generator

## Description

I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:

* Length (between 8 and 128 characters)

* Character type:

  * Special characters 

  * Numeric characters

  * Lowercase characters

  * Uppercase characters

The application validates user input and ensures that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts and it will be displayed to the page.

The user has the option to click a button and copy the password


## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data

I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria

SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Business Context

For companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data, weak passwords can pose a real security threat. An application that can generate strong passwords quickly and effortlessly saves employees time and ensures secure access to data.

## Usage
